# Name

***Why is the project called DraigDeg?***

The name is Welsh. 

**Draig** is Welsh for Dragon, and is pronounced like *"Dry"* followed by a hard *"G"* (as at the end of "Bog"). IPA: /d̪ˠɾˠaɟ/

**Deg** is Welsh for Ten, and is pronounced with a longer *"e"* to rhyme with *"Flair"*. IPA: /dɛɡ/


It kind of means *"The Tenth Dragon"* or *"Dragon Ten"* - not quite literally in idiomatic Welsh, but close enough. 

***OK, but Why?***

The original impetus for this project is a collaboration with a Vietnamese academic institute for monitoring salinity in the Mekong Delta. 

The Mekong Delta (Vietnamese: Đồng bằng Sông Cửu Long) literally translates as **Nine Dragon River Delta**. 

As it is customary for anything exported from Wales to display some dragon iconography, it was fiting that our electronics PCB, featuring a dragon, would make it the 10th.
